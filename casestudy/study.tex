\section{Explorative study}
\label{S:study}

\vspace{-27\in}

In this study, we examine some \Wikipedia{} categories with two objectives: a) to retrieve some candidate classifiers of an emerging taxonomy of software languages; b) to get some experience with \Wikipedia's approach to classification and related issues of style and consistency.\footnote{All \Wikipedia{} data for this study and this paper was retrieved 7-18 June 2013.}

\paragraph*{\textbf{Designation of a root}}

\Wikipedia's classification hierarchies are complex and thus, it is not straightforward to determine a root for exploration unambiguously. However, we have established by an ad-hoc search that the category \WikipediaCategory{Computer languages} may be a suitable root: its intended coverage may be similar to what the SL(E) community has in mind for the notion of software languages.

\autoref{F:clLevel12} showed all the immediate (i.e., level 1) subcategories of the category \WikipediaCategory{Computer languages}. Several of these immediate subcategories are excluded because they are not directly concerned with the \emph{classification} of languages: \WikipediaCategory{Lists of computer languages}, \WikipediaCategory{Articles with example code}, \WikipediaCategory{Data types}, and \WikipediaCategory{Programming language topics}. One of the remaining immediate subcategories is the category \WikipediaCategory{Programming languages}. We found another major classifier for programming languages, namely \WikipediaCategory{Programming language classification}, which is reachable through the excluded category \WikipediaCategory{Programming language topics}.

\paragraph*{\textbf{Level-by-level extraction}}

We decided to extract another level to obtain a graph of manageable size. Again, we excluded several categories, if they did not meet our objective of language classification. As a result, we obtained the categories shown in \autoref{F:twolevels}. This is a pretty manageable set of language classifiers. 
It happens that they all end on ``... languages'' except for two subcategories of \WikipediaCategory{Markup languages} which end on ``... formats''. In contrast, most of the excluded categories (see below) do not end on ``... languages'' . We take this to provide a hint at the different classification styles of \Wikipedia.

\paragraph*{\textbf{Exclusion types}}

In order to obtain the reduced result of \autoref{F:twolevels}, we had to exclude 29 categories. This may seem like a small number, but it is clear that yet more categories must be excluded once deeper levels are explored. We used these 29 exclusions to develop a small set of exclusion types for the study; see \autoref{F:metaclassify} for the list of excluded categories with the associated exclusion type:

{\small

\begin{description}

\item[Alternative classifier] The category classifies software languages in a manner that is not related to software concepts. For instance, the category \WikipediaCategory{Academic programming languages} describes itself as being concerned with languages that are ``influential in computer science and programming language theory''.

\item[Deviating classifier] The category does not actually classify software languages. It rather classifies something else. For instance, category \WikipediaCategory{Articles with example code} describes itself as being concerned with ``articles which include reference implementations of algorithms''.

\item[Singleton classifier] The category is effectively concerned with a single software language for which it serves as a container of related entities such as technologies or standards. For instance, category \WikipediaCategory{Cascading Style Sheets} contains pages on all kinds of topics related to the CSS language.

\item[List classifier] The category collects lists or categories of lists (rather than plain categories) of software languages. For instance, category \WikipediaCategory{Lists of computer languages} has \WikipediaCategory{Lists of programming languages} as a subcategory, which in turn contains pages for some lists of languages, such as the \WikipediaPage{List of BASIC dialects}.

\item[Maintenance classifier] The category is used by the \Wikipedia{} authors to capture some information related to the maintenance of pages or categories. For instance, the category \WikipediaCategory{Uncategorized programming languages} describes itself as serving categories or pages ``which need to be classified under more specific categories''. Also: ``This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time.''

% category \WikipediaCategory{Markup language stubs} describes itself as serving ``for stub articles relating to markup languages''. The

\paragraph*{\textbf{An observation regarding \Wikipedia{} style}}

The resulting classification of \autoref{F:twolevels} with the remaining level-1 and level-2 subcategories is of a manageable size. We may review the classification and observe some of its characteristics in this manner. During the study, we realized, for example, an asymmetry between `query' versus `transformation'. That is, there is a category \WikipediaCategory{Transformation languages} at level 1, but there is apparently no category for `query languages', not even at level 2. Let us inspect the page for \WikipediaPage{SQL}, which is an obvious query language. It turns out that \WikipediaPage{SQL} is a member of various categories including a category \WikipediaCategory{Query languages} which in turn is a subcategory of various categories including the category \WikipediaCategory{Domain-specific programming languages} which occurred in \autoref{F:twolevels}. Let us compare this classification scheme with the one of \WikipediaPage{XSLT}, which is an obvious transformation language: it is a member of the categories \WikipediaCategory{Transformation languages}, \WikipediaCategory{Declarative programming languages}, \WikipediaCategory{Functional languages}, \WikipediaCategory{Markup languages}, \WikipediaCategory{XML-based programming languages}, and yet other categories that may count as `alternative classifiers'. However, \WikipediaPage{XSLT} (unlike \WikipediaPage{SQL}) is not a member of the category \WikipediaCategory{Domain-specific programming languages}.

\WikiTax{} is helpful in making such observations regarding consistency (or lack thereof) of classification on \Wikipedia.

\paragraph*{\textbf{Programming languages: all levels}}

According to \autoref{F:twolevels}, the subcategory of \WikipediaCategory{Computer languages} with by far the most subcategories is 
\WikipediaCategory{Programming languages}. Thus, we embarked on a more comprehensive exploration of category \WikipediaCategory{Programming languages}:

Initially, we extracted 423 categories over 8 levels with 7515 pages. The automatic extraction took several minutes. We performed exclusion in two steps. First, we (re-) excluded those direct subcategories that already appeared in \autoref{F:metaclassify}. After such initial pruning, 288 categories with 6671 pages remained. We completed reduction at all levels of the category graph. This process required about 2 hours of manual work to determine what categories to remove and for what reason. This effort is intrinsically manual; it requires domain knowledge and involves consultation of the relevant and additional \Wikipedia{} pages. Ultimately, 79 categories over 4 levels with 1560 pages remained.  \autoref{F:plNumbers} visualizes the reduced taxonomy for two different metrics supported by \WikiTax.

On the left, the metric for the \emph{number of transitive member pages} is applied for visualization. No category is grayed out, which means that there is no category without members. Most of the categories are shown in a plain font, which means that they all carry members, but less than 25\,\% of the total members in the category \WikipediaCategory{Programming languages} (which has 1560 member pages). There is actually one heavyweight: category \WikipediaCategory{Domain-specific programming languages} carries 976 members, which is more than 50\,\% of all members; this status is expressed by 
highlighting the category.

On the right, the metric for the number of transitive subcategories is applied for visualization. Most subcategories of \WikipediaCategory{Programming languages} do not have any subcategories; thus, they are grayed out. 7 out of 36 level-1 categories carry subcategories. 6 out of these 7 categories carry only very few subcategories (less than 5). Category \WikipediaCategory{Domain-specific programming languages} carries 18 subcategories, which is more than 25\,\% of all subcategories; this status is expressed by highlighting the category.
