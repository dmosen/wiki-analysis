@ARTICLE{Ebert1987AVD,

  title = {A Versatile Data Structure For Edge-Oriented Graph Algorithms},
  journal = {Communications ACM},
  year = {1987},
  volume = {30},
  pages = {513-519},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {We describe an abstract module for graph handling that is especially
	suited for the edge-oriented paradigm of programming graph algorithms,
	and show how this module can be implemented efficiently in Algol-like
	languages. This graph relization is of the adjacency-list type and
	is suitable for directed and undirected graphs (with multiple edges
	allowed). Undirected graphs are represented as directed graphs through
	arbitrary assignment of directions to every edge(and not through
	storage of the corresponding symmetric graph). This representation
	has been used successfully in a number of applications; for instance,
	it has been used as a tool for representing the graphs in the EMS
	project on the implementation of functional languages.}
