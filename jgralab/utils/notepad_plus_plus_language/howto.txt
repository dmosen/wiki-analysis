GReQL-Syntax-Highlighting for Notepad++
---------------------------------------

The userDefineLang.xml file contains a user-defined language for Notepad++ (created for Version 5.8.2). 
The user-defined language provides Syntax-highlighting for GReQL files. 
Files with the ending ".greql" will automatically select this language after installation.


++ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ++

1. If you don't have an userDefineLang.xml file already in you Notepad++ configuration directory 
   (e.g. on Win7: C:\Users\XX\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++), you can drop this file among your other 
   configuration file, in the Notepad++ config folder. It should be named userDefineLang.xml.
2. Otherwise, open both the existing and new file.
	1. Select all of the new file, copy, and paste at the end of the current file.
	2. This will have created a spurious </Notepad_Plus><Notepad_plus> pair in the middle, each 
	   tag on a line by itself. Remove these two consecutive lines.
	3. Close Notepad++. 

Your Languages menu will show the newly added language at the bottom, next time you launch Notepad++. 

See https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=User_Defined_Language_Files for
further information.


++ EDIT LANGUAGE ++

To edit the GReQL language or add own user-defined languages, open "View -> User-Defined Languages".
