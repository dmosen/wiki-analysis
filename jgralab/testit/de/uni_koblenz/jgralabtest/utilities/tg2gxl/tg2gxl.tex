\chapter{General approch}The \emph{tg2gxltest} package contains a set of schemas stored in .tg files. Graphs of this schemas are created by running several \emph{greql-script}s, which are located in this package, too.

The resulting graphs get also stored in .tg files, which finally get trasmitted to the \emph{Tg2Gxl} converter.

The resulting .gxl files syntactical correctness will be reviewed by an platform dependent GXL converter.
Their semantical correctness has to be verified \"'by hand\"'.
 
\emph{Note}

Unless there exists an ant script you have to profrom following steps chronologically.
\begin{itemize}
\item Run ExecuteGreqlScripts.class
\item Run ConvertGraphs2GXL.class
\item Validate the resulting .gxl files by hand.
\end{itemize}
Tg2Gxl is not yet capable to handle RecordDomain attributes. Unless it does, RecordDomain attributes are NOT part of this test.
